# CloseEval3D
Documentation and codes for close evaluation problem in 3D.

The codes contained in the Jupyter notebook in this repository were used to illustrate methods described in the manuscript "Close evaluation of layer potentials in three dimensions" by C. Carvalho, S. Khatri, and A. D. Kim (https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02474). These examples were used for a seminar talk entitled, "Close evaluation of layer potentials in three dimensions" given by A. D. Kim on November 1, 2019.
